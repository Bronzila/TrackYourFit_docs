## Design guidelines
### General
Try to use as many material icons as possible:

Bootstrap cards and bootstrap grid system are good for highlithing and layouting parts of the page
### Tables
All html tables need to have the following classes:
- table
- table-hover
- table-light
- table-striped
### Buttons
Depending on the functionality of the button you need to adjust the button classes of your buttons. The bootstrap class "btn" is standard for every button.
- No special function/Nav --> "button-primary"  = blue
- Deleting                --> "button-delete"   = red
- Edit                    --> "button-edit"     = yellow
- Save                    --> "button-save"     = green
- Add                     --> "button-save"     = green
- Action                  --> "button-save"     = green
